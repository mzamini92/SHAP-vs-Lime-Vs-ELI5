# SHAP-vs-Lime-Vs-ELI5


This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on predicting stroke occurrence in a healthcare dataset. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient is at risk of having a stroke based on various health-related features.

Data Source: The dataset used in this project is the "healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv," which contains information about patients' demographics, medical history, and whether they had a stroke.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

Data Exploration and Preprocessing: The project begins by importing necessary libraries, loading the dataset, and performing data exploration. It includes tasks such as checking for missing values, handling missing data, and visualizing the distribution of numeric variables like age, glucose level, and BMI. These visualizations help in understanding the dataset and identifying any potential patterns or correlations.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The EDA phase focuses on visualizing the impact of different features on the likelihood of having a stroke. This includes analyzing the distribution of age, glucose level, and BMI in stroke and non-stroke cases. The project utilizes Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative visualizations.

Data Preprocessing: This section covers data preprocessing steps, such as encoding categorical variables like gender, residence type, and work type. The data is split into training and testing sets, and oversampling techniques (SMOTE) are applied to address class imbalance issues.

Model Selection: The project explores several machine learning models, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression. Each model is fine-tuned using grid search and evaluated using cross-validation. The choice of the best model is based on F1 score, accuracy, and other relevant metrics.

Model Interpretability: To explain the model's predictions, the project uses model interpretability tools such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), Lime (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), and Eli5 (Explain Like I'm 5). These tools provide insights into how the model makes decisions and highlight the importance of different features in predicting strokes.

Model Evaluation: The models' performance is evaluated using various metrics, including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves. Different thresholds for classification are also explored to understand the trade-off between precision and recall.

Model Deployment: The project demonstrates how to deploy the final model for real-world predictions, considering not only model accuracy but also interpretability using SHAP, Lime, and Eli5.

Including SHAP, Lime, and Eli5 in the project provides a comprehensive approach to not only building accurate models but also understanding and explaining the model's decision-making process. These tools are essential for model transparency and trustworthiness, especially in healthcare applications.

## Project Goals

Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Thoroughly explore the dataset, handle missing values, and preprocess the data to prepare it for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct an in-depth analysis of the data to understand the relationships between various features and the incidence of strokes. This analysis will lay the foundation for building an interpretable model.

Model Selection and Interpretability: Implement and fine-tune different machine learning models, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression. Moreover, employ state-of-the-art interpretability tools such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), Lime (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), and Eli5 (Explain Like I'm 5) to elucidate how the model makes predictions.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using standard metrics, including accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves. Additionally, assess the interpretability of the model's predictions by leveraging SHAP, Lime, and Eli5.

Model Deployment: Create a pathway for deploying the final model in a healthcare setting, ensuring that healthcare professionals and patients can confidently use the model to predict the risk of strokes while having access to clear explanations of the model's reasoning.
